<h2>My Role Model</h2>
<h3 style="color:Dodgerblue; border-style:dotted; border-color:violet;"> Sophia Nash-Cole (My Mother)</h3>
<p> "If you fail today, you can try again tomorrow." This is a small motto that we live by in our household, it is often said by my mother especially in times of stress. My role model is my mother, I chose her because from inception she has been and will continue to be the main person who helps to guide me in life. She has done so much in life and bounced back from many failed attempts, I have grown and watched her do many inspiring things. She teaches me that mistakes are a part of life, and that perseverance is the best way to go through life. She highlights her mistakes and teaches me how to avoid doing the same things or wind up on the same path as she did which gave her trouble. I aspire to be a strong and brave woman live her one day.

<h2> Personality Test </h2><center>
<img src="./Assets/Results.png" alt="Result" height="70%" width="50%" /></center>
<br> </br>
<h3> Evaluation of my Results </h3>
<p> This test is not a great representation of my true personality. It asks basic question and the result that is derived can somewhat be accurate but in a general perspective. An example is the Vital results state that if you score low potential flaws are depression, poor mental and or physical strength. A person can score low based on the questions that are asked don’t specifically cater to them and they have none of those flaws. Personally, the questions that were asked would not be able to accurately evaluate me, but the results are almost an accurate representation on how I am in those areas.     </p>

<h2> “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener </h2>
<h3> Applying it to my life</h3>
<p> In the chapters 4 to 7 of “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, these were about goals, surrounding yourself with the best people and continuous learning. The conversation between Charlie and Michael revolves around good habits for personal development. It is advised that to move forward in life you should have your goals written down, this helps you to realize and remember what you want to achieve. I could use this in my life because I currently haven’t put much thought to goals in life or achieving them. This taught me that I can also break down my goals from short term to long-term making it easier for achievement. 
In another conversation Charlie again advised Michael of how his time and his social circle can affect how he has been perceiving things and his advancement in life. This helped me to realized that if you only have friends that are bound to one place or have no future this will also influence your attitude. I could apply this to my life by beginning to weed out the friends or associates who are not benefiting me and helping me to kill my potential. I should also look into building my self first and then I may attract others who want the same mindset as me. Charlie also taught Michael that learning never stop once you grow older. In orders to grow and become successful self-education is the key and can be done through reading, learning from others and reflection. I can apply this point to my life as I am not much of a reader and reading open your mind to vast new information. From these chapters in the book the message is clearly stated strategic goal setting, positive associations and continuous learning are fundamental elements in growing and achieving a successful life.
